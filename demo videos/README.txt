We recorded the videos on two different days at two different locations with two different subjects holding the FDA patch.
The detection model used was YOLOv5. The pedestrian bounding boxes with confidence higher than 0.5 are displayed.
We performed pedestrian detection with input image size of 640, but to save space, we display the videos with a resolution of 400.
